"""Thin wrapper around CVXPY's ``Problem.solve`` with typed error mapping.

The wrapper exists for three reasons:

1.  Centralise the mapping from CVXPY's free-form status strings to our
    typed exception hierarchy (so the optimizer body never needs to
    grow a sprawling ``if status == ...`` chain).
2.  Provide a single place to plumb solver options through (default
    ``CLARABEL`` with sensible tolerances, override via kwargs).
3.  Provide a tiny ``SolverResult`` container so callers can introspect
    objective value / iteration count without poking at private
    attributes of the CVXPY problem.
